### What I learned

This project helped me a lot in improving my skills as a front-end developer. I'm glad I joined this community as I can do more practice and sharpen my skills. It was a learning experience since I am a total beginner.

``` CSS
: root {
    --color-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --color-light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --color-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --color-darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}```


### Continued development

An area I had trouble with was CSS as I couldn't figure out some stylings that were required to make the project successful.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - This helped me with the CSS I needed.
